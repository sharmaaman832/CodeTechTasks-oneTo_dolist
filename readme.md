1. Project Title
To-Do List Web Application

2. Project Description:
The To-Do List Web Application is a lightweight, user-friendly tool designed to help users manage their daily tasks effectively. The application allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks while ensuring their data is saved persistently using localStorage. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application is simple yet powerful, catering to users seeking a minimalistic task management solution.

3. Objectives:
Task Management: Allow users to add, complete, and delete tasks.
User Experience: Ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Data Persistence: Store tasks locally in the browser using localStorage to maintain data even after refreshing the page.
Scalability: Provide a foundation for future enhancements like categorization, reminders, or cloud integration.

5. Key Features:
Add Tasks: Input new tasks into the list.
Mark as Complete: Toggle tasks between completed and incomplete states.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Persistent Storage: Save tasks in localStorage to retain them between sessions.

6. Technology Stack:
Frontend:
HTML: For structuring the application.
CSS: For styling and enhancing visual appeal.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and managing functionality.

7. Project Architecture:
UI Components: Input section, task list, and individual task items.
Event Handling: Button clicks and list interactions for managing tasks.
Data Management: LocalStorage for persistent storage of tasks.

8. How It Works:
Adding a Task:

Enter text in the input field.
Click the "Add Task" button to append the task to the list.
The task is stored in localStorage.
Marking a Task as Complete:

Click on a task to toggle between completed and incomplete states.
Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strike-through.

Deleting a Task:

Click the "Delete" button associated with a task to remove it from the list.
The task is also deleted from localStorage.

8. Setup and Usage
Clone or download the project repository.
Ensure all files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) are in the same directory.
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
Start adding, managing, and organizing your tasks.

9. Future Enhancements
Add task priorities or categories.
Implement due dates and reminders for tasks.
Create a backend for synchronization across devices.
Add drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering.
